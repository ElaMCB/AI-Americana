# Datasets

U.S. open data that this project actually uses and processes.

## Planned Sources

- **Census**: American Community Survey (ACS) PUMS data
- **NOAA**: Climate and weather data
- **SEC EDGAR**: Financial filings

Note: Large datasets should be linked externally (GDrive, Zenodo) rather than stored directly in the repo.
